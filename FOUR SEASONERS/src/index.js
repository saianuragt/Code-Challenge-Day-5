// Dinesh also joined the group of 3 idiots and now their group is called Four Seasoners. 
// Meanwhile, Binoy has moved to a new house in the same locality. 
// Now the houses of Ajay, Binoy and Chandru are in the located in the shape of a triangle. 
// Dinesh also has moved to a house in the same locality. When Ajay asked Dinesh about the location of his house , 
// Dinesh said that his house is equidistant from the houses of the other 3. Though Ajay was good in Mathematics, he was puzzled. 
// Can you please help Ajay out?

// Given the 3 vertices {(x1,y1), (x2,y2) and (x3,y3)} of a triangle, 
// write a function to determine the point which is equidistant from all the 3 vertices.

// write a function to return the X co-ordinates.
function find_X_Vertices(X1,Y1,X2,Y2,X3,Y3){
    let P1 = (X1+X2+X3)/3;
    return P1;
}

// write a function to return the Y co-ordinates.
function find_Y_Vertices(X1,Y1,X2,Y2,X3,Y3){
    let P2 = (Y1+Y2+Y3)/3;
    return P2;
}
